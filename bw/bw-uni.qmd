title: "Univariate Viz"

Use this file to generate a professional looking **univariate** visualization. The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.


```{r}
hikes <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/high_peaks.csv")
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```


```{r}
#| fig-cap: "The Varied Elevation of the Adirondack's 46 Highest Peaks"
#| fig-alt: "This graph plots the elevation of the Adirondack's 46 highest peaks as well as the frequency of each elevation"

ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 100) +
  labs(title = "The Varied Elevation of the Adirondack's 46 Highest Peaks", x = "Elevation in Feet", y = "Number of Trails", caption = "Izzy Flood. February 2025.
